            To experience some of the most inspiring views America has to offer, plan a trip to Grand Canyon National Park. A bucket-list item for many travelers, this Arizona park is a superb spot to hike, offering scenic paths like the Bright Angel and North Kaibab trails. The Colorado River weaves its way through the 277-mile-long canyon, which also makes it a top destination for whitewater rafting. But for a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience, travelers can view this impressive natural wonder on a helicopter tour. Regardless of how you choose to spend your time in the Grand Canyon, you're sure to feel small against its towering rock formations and expansive vistas
